## Coupled parameterized reduced order modelling of thermo-mechanical phenomena arising in blast furnace ##

### 0. Introduction

This repository contains numerical implementation of the benchmark tests reported in "Coupled parameterized reduced order modelling of thermo-mechanical phenomena arising in blast furnace" (see https://zenodo.org/record/3888145). 

### 1. Prerequisites

We use **python** 3.6.9 as the programming language. In this project we use the libraries :
* **FEniCS** 2019.1.0 (www.fenicsproject.org)
* **RBniCS** 0.1.dev1 (www.rbnicsproject.org)
* **Matplolib** 3.1.2 (www.matplotlib.org)
* **numpy** 1.17.4 (www.numpy.org)

The solutions are stored in **.pvd** format, which can later be viewed with **Paraview** (www.paraview.org).

### 2. Installation

Simply clone the public repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/ROMSOC/benchmark_thermomechanical_model
```

### 3. Running the benchmark cases

Source codes for input data are provided in the folder "source_files". Source codes for running the benchmark are provided in folder "source". After running the benchmark, results are stored in folder "result_files".

Run required .py file e.g. "file_name.py" as,
```
python3 file_name.py
```
